This page aims to connect you to other organizations and institutions which are also active in publishing guidelines and 
best practices and promote FAIR data and open-source practices within the more general scope within the scientific software
development communities. As such, we also include references from the literature, from which we have benefited in order to
develop our guidelines and best practices for the computer and molecular sciences communities. 

Since this list is by no means complete, please let us know if you think we have missed or overlooked an important reference.

This page aims to connect you to other organizations and institutions which are also active in publishing guidelines and 
best practices and promote FAIR data and open-source practices within the more general scope within the scientific software
development communities. As such, we also include references from the literature, from which we have benefited in order to
develop our guidelines and best practices for the computer and molecular sciences (CMSs) communities. 

The provided list is not meant to be complete but the intention is to include only those resources that can be impactful 
to the CMS communities. Please let us know, by opening an issue in our `Github Repository <https://github.com/MolSSI/molssi-guidelines>`_,
if you think we have missed or overlooked an important reference.
